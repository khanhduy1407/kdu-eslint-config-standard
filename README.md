> eslint-config-standard for Kdu CLI

This config is specifically designed to be used by Kdu CLI setups
and is not meant for outside use (it can be used but some adaptations
on the user side might be needed - for details see the config file).

A part of its design is that this config may implicitly depend on
other parts of Kdu CLI setups, such as `eslint-plugin-kdu` being
extended in the same resulting config.
